# Bike Sharing Data Project

üìå Overview

This project was developed during my internship at Next Hikes IT Solutions. The objective of the project was to analyze a large dataset of bike-sharing records and generate valuable insights for decision-making.

Using Excel as the primary tool, I performed data cleaning, transformation, visualization, and dashboard creation to identify usage patterns, trends, and performance metrics.
